# Overview

This is a Node.js workspace project that appears to be in early development stages. The project is set up with authentication capabilities using OpenID Connect and database connectivity through Neon (serverless PostgreSQL) with Drizzle ORM. The current structure suggests this will be a web application with OAuth-based authentication and cloud database integration.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Database Layer
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL database accessed via connection pooling
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Shared schema definition located in `@shared/schema` (imported but not present in current files)
- **Connection Management**: Uses connection pooling with `@neondatabase/serverless` for optimal serverless performance

## Authentication System
- **Protocol**: OpenID Connect (OIDC) implementation using `openid-client` library
- **Rationale**: OIDC provides standardized authentication flows and supports multiple identity providers
- **Benefits**: Secure, industry-standard authentication with broad provider compatibility

## Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Memoization capabilities through `memoizee` library for function result caching
- **Purpose**: Reduces redundant computations and improves response times for frequently called functions
- **WebSocket Support**: Custom WebSocket constructor configuration for Neon database connections

## Project Structure
- **Modular Design**: Separation between server-side database logic and shared schema definitions
- **Environment Configuration**: Database connection configured via environment variables for security and flexibility
- **TypeScript Support**: Type definitions included for enhanced development experience and type safety

# External Dependencies

## Database Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database service
- **Connection**: Configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Driver**: `@neondatabase/serverless` for optimized serverless database connections

## Authentication Services
- **OpenID Connect**: External identity provider integration capability
- **Library**: `openid-client` for OIDC protocol implementation
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple OIDC-compliant identity providers

## Development Libraries
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations and query building
- **Memoizee**: Function memoization for performance optimization
- **WebSocket**: Node.js WebSocket library for real-time database connections
- **TypeScript**: Enhanced development experience with type definitions for memoizee

## Runtime Requirements
- **Node.js**: Server runtime environment
- **Environment Variables**: `DATABASE_URL` required for database connectivity
